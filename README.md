# Business-Database
Hello!
This is Niraj Sookdeo's final project for Programming Fundamentals II for the Spring 2022 semester. This project uses text files as databases and can be manipulated and updated in many ways through the program's interface.

-Currently, users can:
>Add entries to all databases

>Alter entries for all databases

>Calculate simple bonuses for sales representatives based on number of sales

>Pull up a sales report on all products currently selling

>Make purchases for clients that update all databases (excluding sales representatives)

-The menu should be freely navigated and users should be able to view/interact with every database without exiting the program.

-For documentation on how ListInfo, OptionSelect, AddEntry, and ChangeEntry member functions work, refer to Client class.

-If there are any questions or suggestions, email me at: sookdeo.n@outlook.com
